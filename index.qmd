## Introduction

This is an introduction to Cox Proportional Hazards regression, which is a statistical method used for survival analysis. It uses a semi-parametric estimator that focuses on estimating the hazard function which represents the instantaneous risk of an event occurring at a given time. It's mostly used in industries such as medical, epidemiology and various other fields where they need to analyze data pertaining to a failure or an event such as death or relapse. [Gonzalez-Dominguez] The purpose of Cox Proportional Hazards regression is to find the relationship between one or more independent variables and the hazard function while allowing for the exploration in non-linearity and time-varying effects. [W.W.M Abeysekera] The dependent variable in a hazard model consist of two parts, the first part is the event indicator and the second part is a measure of time. [Jane E.Miller] The purpose of this paper is to take a dive deeper into this regression model by analyzing the (insert data set here). This data set will use the regression to [add pertaining information here].

## Methods

The common non-parametric regression model is
$Y_i = m(X_i) + \varepsilon_i$, where $Y_i$ can be defined as the sum of
the regression function value $m(x)$ for $X_i$. Here $m(x)$ is unknown
and $\varepsilon_i$ some errors. With the help of this definition, we
can create the estimation for local averaging i.e. $m(x)$ can be
estimated with the product of $Y_i$ average and $X_i$ is near to $x$. In
other words, this means that we are discovering the line through the
data points with the help of surrounding data points. The estimation
formula is printed below [@R-base]:

$$
M_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} W_n (X_i) Y_i  \tag{1}
$$ $W_n(x)$ is the sum of weights that belongs to all real numbers.
Weights are positive numbers and small if $X_i$ is far from $x$.

## Analysis and Results

### Data and Vizualisation

A study was conducted to determine how...

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=T, message=FALSE}
# loading packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)
library(dslabs)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Load Data
kable(head(murders))

ggplot1 = murders %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x=population/10^6, y=total)) 

  ggplot1 + geom_point(aes(col=region), size = 4) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=abb)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_smooth(formula = "y~x", method=lm,se = F)+
  xlab("Populations in millions (log10 scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log10 scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Region")+
      theme_bw()
